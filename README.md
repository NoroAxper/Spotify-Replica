# Spotify-Replica

At Boolean UK we were set a challenge to replicate an older version of Spotify.
I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to both look and perform as similar as possible with the abilities I had at that time.
I am most proud of my implementation to allow header to fade on scroll while the background colour has a dynamic gradient and
performs very similar to Spotify's. I found that it was the most appealing feature on the app and didn't know how to do it, so I challenged 
myself to solve the problem and know how to do it.

I have deployed the repo on vercel and it is available to view a live demo. 
I would really appreciate if you viewed the work I am so proud of and see it in action üòÅ
Thank you

Today we are building the UI for Spotify. This exercise will put into practice everything we have learned about HTML & CSS. Layouts for apps are different to websites so this will put your CSS Grid skills to the test!

## Instructions
In the `screens` folder you will see images of spotify at different resolutions. Your goal is replicate this layout structure as closely as possible. The image assets needed to complete the exercise are in the `assets/img` folder.

For the player icons, you can use your own images or Font Awesome icons (https://fontawesome.com/v4.7/icons/).

## Assesment Criteria
* &#9745; The overall structure of the layout reflects the `spotify-lg.png` reference image. 
* &#9745; Fonts, colors and spacings used are similar (they don't need to be identical) to the reference images
* &#9745; CSS avoids repetition.
* &#9745; CSS class names are descriptive.
* &#9745; HTML is semantic and well structured.

### Extension Criteria
* &#9745; The left menu collapses as shown in `spotify-xs.png`.
* &#9745; The list of albums expands and collapses to fill the available page space (see `spotify-md.png` and `spotify-s.png`)
* &#9745; The top navigation list wraps as the page size is reduced.
* &#9745; On hovering over cover images, a play icon appears overlaid.
* &#9745; Only the main content area scrolls - it moves behind the upgrade bar and the player controls. The side menu also stays fixed as the main content scrolls.
